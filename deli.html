                           <li>
                            Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and cook until browned on both sides and has an internal temperature of 165°F. Remove from skillet and cover to keep warm. Wipe the skillet clean.                           
                           </li> 
                           <li> 
                            Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high. Add the pasta to the boiling water, and cook according to the package directions. Drain well, reserving ½ cup of the cooking water. Keep warm.                            
                           </li>
                           <li>
                            While the pasta is cooking, combine the cream, butter, and garlic in the same skillet as you cooked the chicken.                            
                           </li> 
                           <li> 
                            Cook over medium heat, whisking often until the butter is melted. Whisk in the salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened.
                           </li>
                            <li>
                                Gradually whisk in parmesan cheese.    
                            </li>

                                    Whisk until the sauce is smooth.                  
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Remove the alfredo sauce from the heat and add the cooked pasta to it. Toss to coat, adding a bit of reserved cooking water as needed to thin the sauce.                        
                          </li> 
                        <li>
                            Slice the chicken breasts into ½-inch-thick strips. Divide the pasta among bowls, top with the sliced chicken, and garnish the chicken alfredo with parsley.
