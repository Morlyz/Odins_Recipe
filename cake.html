                    <p>how to make:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> 
                            In a small saucepan, combine the strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook while frequently stirring until the mixture is thick and jammy. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium mixing bowl.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a large mixing bowl or the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla and beat until light and fluffy.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually add in a third of the flour mixture, followed by half of the milk. Repeat, alternating with the remaining flour and milk. Add the lemon juice and beat just until combined. Divide the batter among the three greased 8-inch baking pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 20 minutes before transferring them to wire cooling racks to finish cooling.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until very pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add in half of the powdered sugar before beating in the strawberry reduction. Beat in the remaining powdered sugar before adding the lemon juice and heavy cream. Beat on medium-low speed until fluffy.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place 2 cups of frosting in a piping bag with a decorative tip. Place a cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread ½ cup frosting over the top of the cake layer.                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pipe a border on the edge. Spread 3 tablespoons of strawberry reduction in the middle of the frosting border. Top with another cake layer and repeat with frosting and reduction.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Top with the remaining cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting over the sides and top of the cake, and pipe decorations on the cake as desired.                        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Garnish with fresh strawberries and lemon zest if desired.                        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pipe any leftover frosting on top between the garnishes if desired. Chill the strawberry lemonade cake for 2 hours before slicing.                    
                        </li>
