                    There’s something so addictive about cream cheese frosting; sweetness is tempered with a bit of tang, the texture is creamy and luscious and it’s something you can whip up in a few minutes. I love this frosting on nearly everything but a slightly chocolatey cake creates a special combination known as red velvet!

                    <p>how to make:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> 
                            To make the cupcakes; preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place cupcake papers in a cupcake pan. In a large bowl, sift the dry ingredients (including the sugar) into the bowl of a stand mixer and give it a whisk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients until they are well combined, then add some red food coloring. (The batter may be clumpy but do not worry).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cut the butter into tablespoon sized dollops and add it to the dry ingredients in the stand mixer and beat together. This should get you a sort of crumbly mixture.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With your mixer running on low, add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture and mix until everything is incorporated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may want to add a dash or two more of red food coloring until you reach the desired color.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Distribute the batter evenly into the cupcake papers and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the cupcakes are golden and springy to the touch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For the cream cheese frosting; start off by sifting the confectioners sugar into a large bowl so there are not any lumps.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cream the room temperature butter in a standing mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed until it is nice and smooth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the cream cheese and beat together until they’re combined then add the vanilla and salt. Slowly add the sifted confectioners sugar in cups and mix until combined.
                        </li>

                    These chocolate cupcakes are a chocolate lover’s dream come true. The cake is rich, and fudgey but with a fluffy consistency that melts in your mouth. I love pairing them with a dreamy chocolate Swiss buttercream since it’s so creamy, and light but not too sweet. I have a link below for my decadent and sweeter American chocolate buttercream recipe if you have a sweet tooth that demands satisfaction though.

                        <p>how to make:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>
                            Sift the Flour, cocoa powder, salt, sugar and baking soda into a large bowl then whisk together. Sifting is important for chocolate recipes as the cocoa powder has a tendency to clump up.
                           </li> 
                           <li> 
                             Add the sour cream, buttermilk, eggs, and veggie oil into a large bowl and whisk together. Pour the hot coffee in while you whisk and set aside. The coffee doesn’t have to be hot but because the eggs have been mixed in with all the other wet ingredients you won’t end up with a bowl of scrambled eggs!
                            </li>
                           <li>
                            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk together. Scrape the bowl down and give it a really good stir.
                            </li> 
                           <li> 
                            The batter will be VERY thin but don’t worry, it will bake into the MOST MOIST fudgey chocolate cupcakes ever. Fill the cupcake papers 2/3 the way full and bake at 350F for 15-20 minutes or until the centers are set. Don’t over-fill the papers as the batter will rise a good amount.                            </li>
                           <li>
                            Add egg whites, sugar and salt in a bowl. Give the mixture a brief whisk. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Make sure the water does not touch the bowl. Whisk the egg whites occasionally while it warms up. When the mixture has warmed, whisk it constantly. You will heat the mixture until it reaches an internal temperature of 160ºF or until it’s not grainy between your fingers.                           </li> 
                           <li> 
                            Transfer the egg mixture to a stand mixer, mix with a whisk attachment until you get room temperature glossy peaks. You can add bags of frozen peas around the bowl to cool it down quicker if you’re in a hurry, which I usually am!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Switch to a paddle attachment and with the mixer running on low add a tablespoon at a time of the room temperature butter. DON’T WORRY when the mixture starts thinning out. It will whip up into the proper consistency once all the butter is added in.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                            Drizzle in the melted and cooled chocolate while the mixer is running on low. Scrape the bowl down and mix again. You can now transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip and decorate the cooled cupcakes.

                                Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding the next, scraping down the bowl in between. Beat in the vanilla.                            <li>
